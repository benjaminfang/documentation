Measure of Concentration
==========================

The measure of concentration is a method used to quantify
the concentration of solutions. Such measurements include
molarity, mass-volume percent, volume percent, and others.

Terminology
--------------

Solute:
    The material be dissolved.

Solvent:
    The material used to dissolve solute.

Solution:
    The liqued of solute and solvent.

Molarity or molar concentration
----------------------------------
Given the Molarity of a solution M Mol/L, it mean that there is M Molar
solute within one litter.

Mass-Volume Percent
