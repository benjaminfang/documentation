The measurements of concentration is a method used to quantify
the concentration of solutions. Such measurements include
molarity, mass-volume percent, volume percent, and others.

Terminology
-----------------------

Solute: The material be dissolved.

Solvent:
    The material used to dissolve solute.

Solution:
    The liqued of solute and solvent.

Molarity
-----------------

Molarity (denoted by M) equals the moles of the solute (denoted by M_solute)
divided by the liters of solution (denoted by L_solution) after mixing.

.. math::

    M = \frac{M\_solute}{L\_solution}


Mass-volume Percent
----------------------

For mass-volume(denoted by MV) percent, the mass of the solute(denoted by m_solute)
is divided by the volume of the solution(denoted by L_solution).

.. math::

    MV = \frac{m\_solute}{L\_solution}


Volume Percent
------------------

Volume percent(denoted by VP) equals the quotient of the volume of the solute
(denoted by v_solute) divided by the sum of the volumes of the solute and
solvent(denoted by v_solvent).

.. math::

    VP = \frac{v\_solute}{v\_solvent + v\_solute}
