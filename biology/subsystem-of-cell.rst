Subsystems of Cells
======================

Support and Movement System
-----------------------------

This system separates the materials inside the cell from its surroundings, maintains the cell's shape, and enables the cell to move.


Energy Metabolism System
-----------------------------

This system converts light energy into chemical energy, or vice versa. The conversion process enables energy-consuming biological processes to occur.


mass metabolism system
----------------------------

This system synthesizes materials that act as building blocks for cell structures


signalling system
-------------------------

This system senses changes in the external or internal environment and transmits signals to responders that are responsible for initiating a response to the change.

DNA operation system
-----------------------------

This system organizes DNA and maintains its structure and integrity.
